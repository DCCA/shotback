# Shotback PRD (MVP)

## Problem
Users need fast visual feedback from LLMs on UI/screens. Current workflow requires multiple tools to capture, annotate, host, and share.

## Goal
Provide a Chrome extension that captures full-page screenshots, links comments to selected areas, and produces a local share URL for review.

## Target User
- Solo builders and designers reviewing pages with LLM assistance.

## MVP Scope
- Full-page capture (scroll + stitch)
- Box/arrow/text annotations
- Linked per-area comments
- Comment timeline in editor
- Local share URL and local viewer page
- General feedback field included in shared view

## Non-Goals (Current)
- Cloud-hosted links
- Team collaboration
- Account/auth system

## Success Criteria
- User can go from page capture to share URL in under 1 minute.
- Comments are clearly tied to selected areas.
- Shared local viewer reliably shows screenshot + feedback in same profile.
