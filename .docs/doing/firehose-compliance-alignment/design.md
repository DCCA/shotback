# Design: FIREHOSE Compliance Alignment

## Approach
1. Create a single active change folder: `.docs/doing/firehose-compliance-alignment/`.
2. Add required artifacts with concise, high-signal content:
   - `proposal.md`
   - `spec.md`
   - `design.md`
   - `tasks.md`
3. Remove `.docs/doing/current-task.md` to prevent mixed process patterns.

## Rationale
- Keeps `.docs` structure predictable for humans and agents.
- Matches FIREHOSE requirements exactly.
- Minimizes ambiguity about active work state.

## Risks
- Low risk; docs-only change.
