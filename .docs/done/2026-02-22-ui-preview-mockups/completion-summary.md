# Completion Summary: UI Preview Mockups

## What changed
- Created isolated static preview artifacts under `.docs/tmp/ui-preview/`.
- Produced popup/editor/viewer preview screens for pre-implementation sign-off.
- Captured approved direction before runtime refactor.

## Validation
- Preview files were reviewed and approved.

## Risks and follow-ups
- `.docs/tmp/` is now ignored to keep preview artifacts ephemeral.
