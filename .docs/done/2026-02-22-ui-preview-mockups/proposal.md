# Proposal: UI Preview Mockups Before Refactor

## Why
We want visual sign-off before implementing Tailwind + shadcn in the extension UI.

## Scope
- Create static preview mockups for popup, editor, and viewer surfaces.
- Keep previews isolated from production source code.
- Document how to review mockups locally.

## Out of Scope
- Refactoring runtime UI code.
- Installing Tailwind/shadcn in app source.
